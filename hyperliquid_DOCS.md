## About Hyperliquid

### What is Hyperliquid?

Hyperliquid is a performant blockchain built with the vision of a fully onchain open financial system. Liquidity, user applications, and trading activity synergize on a unified platform that will ultimately house all of finance.

### Technical Overview

Hyperliquid is a layer one blockchain (L1) written and optimized from first principles.

**HyperBFT Consensus**: Hyperliquid uses a custom consensus algorithm called HyperBFT inspired by Hotstuff and its successors. Both the algorithm and networking stack are optimized from the ground up to support the unique demands of the L1.

**Dual Execution Model**: Hyperliquid state execution is split into two broad components:

- **HyperCore**: Includes fully onchain perpetual futures and spot order books. Every order, cancel, trade, and liquidation happens transparently with one-block finality inherited from HyperBFT. HyperCore currently supports **200k orders/second**, with throughput constantly improving as the node software is further optimized.

- **HyperEVM**: Brings the familiar general-purpose smart contract platform pioneered by Ethereum to the Hyperliquid blockchain. With the HyperEVM, the performant liquidity and financial primitives of HyperCore are available as permissionless building blocks for all users and builders.

### Hyperliquid 101 for Non-Crypto Audiences

Hyperliquid is a blockchain designed to upgrade the existing financial system. Just as electronic trading dramatically improved markets in the 2000s, Hyperliquid offers an opportunity for a massive technical upgrade of the existing financial system through a transparent, open, and performant blockchain.

**Key Features:**

- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on a public ledger, meaning anyone can view and verify them in real-time.
- **Open access**: Anyone can use and build applications without centralized gatekeepers.
- **Resilience**: A permissionless set of independent validators secure the network.
- **Performance**: Up to 200,000 transactions per second can be processed.

**Key Statistics:**

- **Perpetual futures and spot trading** drive billions in daily volume
- **>$1B in annualized fees** go toward programmatically buying back the HYPE token
- **HYPE token** is used to secure the network, pay for network costs, provide trading fee discounts, and more
- **>$45M in revenue** generated by independent teams using Hyperliquid's liquidity infrastructure through builder codes

**Ecosystem Capabilities:**

- Perpetual futures and spot trading
- Borrowing and lending
- Minting compliant stablecoins
- Launching perpetual contracts on any asset
- Mobile apps, trading terminals, self-custodial wallets

### Core Contributors

Hyperliquid Labs is a core contributor supporting the growth of Hyperliquid, led by **Jeff** and **iliensinc**, who are classmates from Harvard. Other members of the team are from Caltech and MIT and previously worked at Airtable, Citadel, Hudson River Trading, and Nuro.

**Team Background:**

- The team used to do proprietary market making in crypto in 2020 and expanded into defi in the summer of 2022
- Existing platforms were plagued with issues: poor market design, bad tech, and clunky UX
- The team set out to build a product that could solve these issues and provide users with a seamless trading experience

**Key Principles:**

- Designing a performant decentralized L1 with an order book DEX built-in requires intimate understanding of quantitative trading, cutting-edge blockchain technology, and clean UX
- The team actively engages with and listens to the community via Discord
- **Hyperliquid Labs is self-funded** and has not taken any external capital, allowing focus on building without external pressure

### Detailed Fee Structure

**Fee Calculation:**

Fees are based on your rolling 14 day volume and are assessed at the end of each day in UTC. Sub-account volume counts toward the master account and all sub-accounts share the same fee tier. Vault volume is treated separately from the master account.

**Volume Calculation:**

```
(14d weighted volume) = (14d perps volume) + 2 * (14d spot volume)
```

**Perpetuals Fee Tiers:**

|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Wood | >10 HYPE | 5% |
| Bronze | >100 HYPE | 10% |
| Silver | >1,000 HYPE | 15% |
| Gold | >10,000 HYPE | 20% |

| 1 | >0.5% | -0.001% |
| 2 | >1.5% | -0.002% |
| 3 | >3.0% | -0.003% |

**Special Fee Rules:**

- **Growth Mode**: When activated for HIP-3 perps, protocol fees, rebates, volume contributions, and L1 user rate limit contributions are reduced by 90%
- **Deployer Fees**: HIP-3 deployers can configure additional fee share between 0-300% (0-100% for growth mode)
- **Stable Pairs**: Spot pairs between two spot quote assets have 80% lower taker fees, maker rebates, and user volume contribution
- **Aligned Quote Assets**: Benefit from 20% lower taker fees, 50% better maker rebates, and 20% more volume contribution

**Fee Distribution:**

On most other protocols, the team or insiders are the main beneficiaries of fees. On Hyperliquid, fees are entirely directed to the community (HLP, the assistance fund, and deployers). Spot and HIP-3 perp deployers may choose to keep up to 50% of trading fees generated by their deployed assets.

**Staking Linking:**

A "staking user" and a "trading user" can be linked so that the staking user's HYPE staked can be attributed to the trading user's fees.

**Important Notes:**
- The staking user will be able to unilaterally control the trading user
- Linking is permanent - unlinking is not supported
- The staking user will not receive any staking-related fee discount after being linked
- Linking requires the trading user to send an action first, then the staking user to finalize the link

### Builder Codes

Builder codes allow developers to monetize user activity by earning a percentage of trading fees generated by their applications.

**How Builder Codes Work:**

1. **Generate code**: Developers create a unique builder code
2. **Integrate**: Add the code to trading applications
3. **Earn revenue**: Receive a percentage of fees from referred users
